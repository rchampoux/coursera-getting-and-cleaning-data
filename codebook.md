## Overview: ##
This dataset (which is the result of running run_analysis.R) contains aggregate mean data for the estimated means and standard deviations of the features collected in the  Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

## Method: ##
The training and test datasets were combined and then filtered to include only variables which were estimates of the means and standard deviations of the collected signals together with identifier variables for the experiment subject and activity.  A new data set was then formed to include the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Activity is one of WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
Subject is the integer ID of the experiment subject. Original experiment had 30 subjects (1:30)
The remaining variables are the aggregate mean for the stated measure from the original data given the Activity and Subject.
